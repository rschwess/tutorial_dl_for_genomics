Given a set of sequences belonging to different classes, what are the characteristics in the DNA sequence that let us distinguish the classes. For example, given a set of promoter and enhancer sequences, we could ask if there are any patterns in the DNA that let us distinguish between the two.\n","\n","For a 'simple' example, think of two ChIP-seq experiments for two different transcription factors. After analysing the ChIP-seq data, we know at what positions in the genome the two factors bind and the majority of binding sites might be distinct. If we extract the underlying sequences and search for DNA patterns that are enriched in the respective sets, we get an idea what DNA sequences the transcription factor might bind and/or which co-factors influence their binding.\n","\n","Traditionally, people use motif discovery tools for finding overrepresented words and motifs. However, if we move to slightly more complicated questions these methods quickly reach their limits and machine learning approaches become more promising.\n","\n","A more complicated question: If we have multiple sets of enhancers that are active in different tissues and cell types and we have the underlying sequences, can we figure out what sequence patterns are characteristic for what activity? And once we know that can we infer which factors are common and which are tissue specific?\n","\n","For our test dataset we have a simplfied, simulated version of such a task. We simulated 40,000 DNA sequences of length 200 bp. We split them into 4 enhancer classes and populated them with transcription factor binding motifs and other DNA patters to make them distinguishable. However, some motifs are shared between classes, they may overlap each other and are not necessarily perfect matches to the text book motifs. Thats much more how regulatory DNA actually looks like :)!\n","\n","We will use keras to build and train a small convolutional neuronal network to classify our enhancer sequences. Once this network is trained well, we can than investigate how the network has learned to distinguish between the classes and try to relate this back to transcriptions factor motifs and so on.\n","\n","------------\n","\n","You can run the tutorial in this colab notebook or checkout (and clone) the github repository (https://github.com/rschwess/tutorial_dl_for_genomics). From there you can either run everything in an interactive python or ipython session or (especially later when optimizing) just adjust and run python dl_intro.py in the terminal.\n","\n","----------------\n","\n","## Set up \n","\n","We will start by downloading the tutorial data.

In applications, we often don't care what the network has learned as long as it performs well and outperforms our competitors. For many research problems however, we are exactly interested in what the network has learned. What features distinguish a cat from a dog or if it comes to decision making (e.g. health care or self driving cars), we obviously want to be able to understand and be able to justify why a certain decision has been chosen and learn how to correct missbehavior.\n","\n","In genomics we usually want to learn what sequence features distinguish the sequences from one another and map them back to biological properties and factors. The easiest way is to just plot the filter weights. In the first convolutional layer, our filters are just like position weight matrices, multiplying every base at every position with a learned weight and summing the value up (plus a bias and pipe it through the RELU activation function). Unfortunatly, this becomes less straight forward to interpret in deeper layers. There are ways of back engineering and learning the importance of filters in higher layers (e.g. https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift) but we concern ourself only with the simple first layer here.\n","\n","We can get the weigths of the filters from the model, save them as .txt files and plot them out. I wrote a wrapper to plot the filter weigths for you in R. Run the code, check the filter_X.txt files and look at the plots and try to interpret them. In Colab runs you probaly want to download them.\n","\n","* Do any look like transciption factor binding sites you know?\n","* Do you recognize any sequence features that are not binding motifs?\n","* Can you simplify the sequences/ motifs from the plot an query them in a transcription factor binding motif database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/)\n","* What is your best bet: Which sequence motifs did we use for simulating the sequence classes?\n","* Check the input data. Split them up by class into text files with only the sequences one sequence per line (see example). Query them in standard motif analysis tools (e.g. http://rsat.sb-roscoff.fr/oligo-analysis_form.cgi or http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme).
